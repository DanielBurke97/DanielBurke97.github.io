    <p class = "justified-text">Daniel Burke was an incredibly intelligent, kind and loving young man. On 12<sup>th</sup> June 2022 he tragically passed away from a sudden cardiac arrest whilst out running in Malahide Castle. 
    </p>

    <p class = "description">Daniel lived an incredibly happy life. He grew up in Baldoyle and later Portmarnock with his three younger siblings, Orla, Conor and Aoife. Daniel's parents, Aidan and Marie, are incredibly proud of the man Daniel grew to be. 
    </p>

    <p class="description">Daniel had an amazing group of friends from school and college. His hobbies included poker, chess, reading, hiking and running. He loved music and on a sunny day was often found lounging on the garden furniture, beer in hand, listenining to Otis Redding's "Sitting on the Dock of the Bay".  
    </p>

    <p class= "description">Daniel met his partner Hollie on Halloween night in Tamangos in Portmarnock when they were both 18. They became best friends and remained in an incredibly loving and happy relationship until Daniel's passing. In December 2021, Daniel and Hollie moved into their first home together in Malahide. Despite Daniel passing away 6 months later, this home is filled with his laughter and happy memories.
    </p>

    <p class="description">Daniel has had a lasting effect on so many of our lives. He is missed by many but always fondly remebered for his cheeky smile and enjoyment of life.
